## Squid Game - Hopscotch

Hopscotch is a variation of one of the most popular children’s games. In the original hopscotch, you jump from one square to another, avoid some of them along the way and then make your way back. In Squid Game, however, there is quite literally no going back. Players have to jump their way through a bridge that has two glass squares side by side. While one glass square is tempered and will hold up to two players at a time, the square beside it is fragile and whoever jumps on it falls to their death. The “fun” part is figuring out which is which, in this case, sixth seconds or less. 

This game, to bring some fun part, is ilustrated with Sponge Bob being the player, trying to reach his Pinaple House and with Squidward counting the seconds.

The player can "break the glass" on max 4 times before lose the game.
